# Sorting Visualizer Application

## Project Overview
This project is a GUI-based application for visualizing different sorting algorithms using PyQt6. The application allows users to visualize the step-by-step process of sorting an array using various algorithms, such as:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Project Structure

### 1. Setup the Project Environment
- **Install necessary packages**: PyQt6 for GUI, matplotlib (if needed), and other dependencies.
- **Create a Python virtual environment** to manage dependencies.

### 2. Main Components

- **GUI Application (Main Window)**:
  - Use `QMainWindow` as the main window.
  - Create buttons for each sorting algorithm.
  - Include controls for speed adjustment and array size.
  - Add a widget for visualizing the sorting process.

- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Implement each sorting algorithm in a separate function or class.
  - Each algorithm should update the visualization after each significant step using `QTimer` or `QThread`.

- **Visualization**:
  - Use `QPainter` or `QGraphicsView` to draw the current state of the array.
  - Highlight comparisons, swaps, and sorted portions with different colors.

- **User Controls**:
  - Buttons for starting/stopping sorting algorithms.
  - Speed control to adjust the sorting speed.
  - Option to shuffle or reset the array.

### 3. Detailed Implementation

- **Step 1: Set up the Main Window**
  - Design the main window layout using Qt Designer or programmatically.
  - Add buttons for each sorting algorithm.
  - Add a widget for the sorting visualization.

- **Step 2: Implement Sorting Algorithms**
  - Implement the algorithms in Python.
  - Ensure each algorithm works step by step, calling the visualization update function after each significant step.

- **Step 3: Visualization Logic**
  - Implement the visualization update function.
  - Use `QPainter` or similar tools in Qt to draw the current state of the array.

- **Step 4: Integration**
  - Connect the GUI controls to the sorting algorithms.
  - Handle threading to ensure the GUI remains responsive during sorting.

### 4. Testing and Debugging
- Test each sorting algorithm individually.
- Ensure that the visualization correctly represents each step of the sorting process.
- Test different array sizes and sorting speeds.

### 5. Enhancements
- Add more sorting algorithms (e.g., Heap Sort, Radix Sort).
- Add sound effects to accompany sorting steps.
- Allow users to input custom arrays.
